Once upon a time
Deep in the tallest peak
There was a spring with droplets of gold
Spreading joy and propersity to all

Decades later, on one tragic day
The wells went dry, and golden rivers died
The spring went empty
And the land was cast into darkness

Years later, a child
Clad in gold and purple, equipped with optimism
Would dare to end this drought
Descend into the depths

And revive the Joyspring
