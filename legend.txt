Once upon a time
Deep in the tallest peak
There was a spring with droplets of bright burning gold
Spreading joy and prosperity to all

Decades later, on one tragic day
The wells went dry, and golden rivers died
The spring went empty
And the land fell into darkness

Years later, a child
Clad in gold and purple, equipped with optimism and strength
Would seek to end this drought
Descend into the depths

And revive the Joyspring


GAME


As the sun rose, the spring was reborn
Blasting upward with the might of a million stars
Gold rained down from the heavens
Bringing back life and joy to all

The child, gladdened by her success
Rode the spring up into the clouds
Her glider flashed with a spark of gold
And she flew safely home

So with the dawn of a new day
A fresh light gleamed upon the earth
Burning bright in the people's hearts
As they found joy once more

And so ends the legend of the Joyspring
The end
