Legends say it’s up here... Just a while longer.
Some say it doesn’t \nexist, but I don’t \nbelieve them.
It has to be up here.
The light’s getting darker.
When I find this spring, \nthe world will be \nso much better.
No more war, no more fighting.
We’ll be happy.
Always happy.
Forevermore.
It’s... not here.
And there’s no other \nway to go.
Why is it not here? \nIt had to be here.
For me.
For everyone.
*What is it you seek, child?
Who are you?
*The spring?
Yes.
*Alas, another foolish wanderer.
*Go home now, the \nspring does not exist.
But it would solve \neverything.
*But it is \nnot existing.
*There was no point in \ncoming here, child.
No. It must be here.
*Accept terrible reality. \nYou will not find what \nyou are looking for here.
No.
*I will give you time.
No, no, no, no, no.
It’s here, somewhere. Is the voice lying?
My parents need this spring. My friends need this spring.
People have gone up and come \nback down happier. So where is it?
I just need to keep moving forward. \nKeep moving closer.
The spring is there.
It’s there.
It must be... right?
Or is the voice telling the truth?
Is it the truth?
Was my search meaningless? Doomed to fail?
*It is okay, child. Life will move on, and you will be moving with it.
*Go on, now. Go back home.
*I promise, it was not meaningless.
*A fox once ran across the woods, the plains, and the deserts.
*And in the middle of nowhere, he sat down to eat some berries.
Why are you telling me a bedtime story?
*The berries were delicious.
*And after the fox was finished he got up.
*Brushed himself off.
*And ran home again.
What? That’s it?
*Yes. Every full moon, the fox would run across the land to eat those berries.
Why? He spent all that time and energy to eat some berries.
What’s the point of eating those berries so far away?
*To you, the fox spent its life \nchasing after berries.
*To the fox, he spent his life \nchasing his favorite food.
*But he was \nnever satisfied.
*Because he believed that the berries farther \naway would be more delicious.
*And so he ran. \nChasing a myth.
What a foolish idea.
*Yet myths rule \nthe world.
*The fox believed \nin the myth of the berries.
*Your parents believed \nin a myth called money.
*Your society believes \nin a myth called government.
*And you, little one, \nbelieved in the myth of the Joyspring.
*Do not worry. The world you envisioned may not be here, but you are here.
*Following so many others, you are coming and going.
*Walking, talking, living.
*Reaching nowhere, finding nothing.
*But one day, smiling.
*Letting go of your goal. Yes. Birthing new ones too.
*Going forward, ever forward.
*Fighting, losing, dying.
*But ever forwarding toward nothing.
I’m leaving.
*The mountain’s peak is unending.
*And the deepest pits are unceasing.
*The world is not yielding.
*And it is not caring.
*It is just flowing, moving, changing.
You don’t make sense.
*One day you’ll be understanding, my child.
*And one day you’ll be smiling.
My feet hurt.
