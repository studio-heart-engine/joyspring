Legends say it’s up here... Just a while longer.
Some say it doesn’t \nexist, but I don’t \nbelieve them.
It has to be up here.
The light’s getting darker.
When I find this spring, \nthe world will be \nso much better.
No more war, no more fighting.
We’ll be happy.
Always happy.
Forevermore.
It’s... not here.
And there’s no other \nway to go.
Why is it not here? \nIt had to be here.
For me.
For everyone.
What is it you seek, \nchild?
Who?
The spring?
Yes.
Alas, another foolish wanderer.
Go home now, the \nspring does not exist.
But it would solve \neverything.
But it is \nnot existing.
There was no point in \ncoming down here, child.
No. It must be here.
Accept terrible reality. \nYou will not find what \nyou are looking for here.
No.
I will give you time.
No, no, no, no, no.
It’s here, somewhere. Is the voice lying?
People have gone up and come back down happier. So where is it?
I just need to keep moving forward. Keep moving closer.
The spring is there.
It’s there.
It must be... right?
Or is the voice telling the truth?
Is it the truth?
Was my search meaningless? Doomed to fail?
It is okay, child. Life will move on, and you will be moving with it.
Go on, now. Go back home.
I promise, it was not meaningless.
Do not worry. The world you envisioned may not be here, but you are here.
Following so many others, you are coming and going.
Walking, talking, living.
Reaching nowhere, finding nothing.
But one day, smiling.
Letting go of your dreams. Yes. Birthing new ones too.
Going forward, ever forward.
Fighting, losing, dying.
But ever forwarding toward nothing.
I’m leaving.
The mountain’s peak is unending.
And the deepest pits are unceasing.
The world is not yielding.
And it is not caring.
It is just flowing, moving, changing.
You don’t make sense.
One day you’ll be understanding, my child.
And one day you’ll be smiling.
My feet hurt.
