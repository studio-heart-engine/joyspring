Once upon a time
Legends told of a magical golden spring
Hidden among bushes of thyme
Full of joyous voices that laugh and sing

But with the course of war and strife
The world went hollow
The spring dried and died
And the people had no soul to follow

Except for one, a child
Clad in optimism, faith without doubt
Would descend into the wild
Seeking to put an end to this drought

And revive the Joyspring

Once upon a time
A spring lay at the end of a climb
Bubbling gold, dancing joy
Liquid happiness for all to enjoy

Many people from all around the lands
Dared to ascend the rocks and sand
First dressed in hope, strong and proud
But later despaired far above the clouds

And yet the truth, terrible reality
Is not as sullen as it seems
For those who went up in vain
Came back with a peace none could explain

Among sadness, rejection, loss
They fought against the worldâ€™s odds
Ever moving, ever tumbling
But always smiling

And so ends the Legend of the Joyspring
